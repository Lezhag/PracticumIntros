## Callbacks and Promises

# Synchronous vs asynchronous

Synchronous - when instructions are executed in linear fashion - one after another. Even it is an `if` clause, it still
executes linearly.

*Examples* - `vehiclesInventory.renderItems();`

These operations can be `thread-blocking` - since JS is `single-threaded`, executes one thing at a time, execution of
instructions can take a long time.

Asynchronous - opposite of synchronous - when the code execution is paused, or performed in the background or executed
as a response to a trigger, like 'click'

So how does it work?
Handle image click example => `_handleImageClick`

# Callbacks
We have learned about callbacks
Example - `.forEach`

Callbacks can be sync or async
